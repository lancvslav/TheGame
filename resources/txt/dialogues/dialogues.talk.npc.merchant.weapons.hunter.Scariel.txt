Hi, my name is Scariel. I am a local hunter. If you are in need of some hunting equipment, I will gladly help you out.
There is one thing you need to understand. You have to be born with hunter's blood. Otherwise, you can not became true hunter. And if you are not hunter, you can not use hunting equipment. Pretty simple, right?
I am the best shooter in the neighborhood. I can shot an hundred feet distant ant with my eyes closed.
