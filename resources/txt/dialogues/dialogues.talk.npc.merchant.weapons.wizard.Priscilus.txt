Mmmm. Thou seemeth quite sharp. Maybe, we could discuss some magic, would this be of assistance to thee?
Good. Is it thine wish to be mine pupil?
Oh yes, splendid. My heartfelt happiness. Thou shalt see, a man hast to be wise to use sorceries. No dim individual can use such powerful knowledge.
If thine wish is to understand such knowledge, talk to me, and I shalt provide mine best secrets to thee.
